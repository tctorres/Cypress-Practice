# Cypress-Practice
For this practice, we need to create a framework from scratch using any version of cypress and cucumber to test the web page: https://www.demoblaze.com/. 

The framework should include test cases for the following functionalities:

1.  Test the featured items carousel. It should be in a feature including at least 3 scenarios.

2.  Test Navigation to all header links. It should be in a feature including at least 3 scenarios.

3.  Test the categories selection, product selection, adding product to cart, buying cart, removing element from cart. All of the defined scenarios for these functionalities should be on a feature.

Keep in mind the following instructions and tips:

- The framework should be organized using best practices and following what suits best to the software under test. 
- All defined scenarios should be tagged in any way you decide, including at least tags for organization and for different suites (regression, smoke, sanity), additionally you could add some tags for hooks.
- The framework should include at least the use of: cy.request, cy.intercept, POM, fixtures.
- Test cases to implement should be designed following best practices and correct organization.
- The use of cucumber is mandatory.
